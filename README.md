# puzzles
Fun and challenging logic/word/coding puzzles ("puzzle hunt" genre) for problem solvers!

### Rules
- Unless otherwise specified, the answer to each puzzle is a single word or name in English.
- You may use the Internet or any other tools to help you solve the puzzles.
- Some puzzles may have hints. Attempt to solve the puzzle on your own first. If you get stuck, look at a hint and try the puzzle again. Reveal the hints in ascending order (look at `hint-1` first, `hint-2` second, etc.).
- Directories containing coding puzzles may have scripts used to generate them. Only look at files marked as 'PUZZLE' in these directories.
- Have fun!
