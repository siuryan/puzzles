# Counterfeit Legos

Agent P, we have a situation. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has built a new device, the Lego-copy-inator, which has been pumping fake Legos into the world's supply. At first glance, these fake Legos seem identical to regular Legos, but we were able to develop an algorithm that detects the frauds. We recovered the attached images from Doofenshmirtz's lab and ran the algorithm on those images. The images of fake Legos should be marked with a red X. We also found a list of coordinates, but we don't know how or if these coordinates relate to the images. Agent P, we need you to figure out Doofenshmirtz's next target and stop him before he can get there. Good luck.
